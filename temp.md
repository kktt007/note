1．早期借用词--大陆时期

2．第二期借用词--古英语时期

3．第三期借用词--中古英语时期
中古时期对英语词汇影响最大的是法语，而法语属于罗马语族（又称拉丁语族），是由古拉丁语演变而来，属于拉丁语的分支，因此很难判定哪些词是英语直接从古拉丁语借来的，哪些词是通过法语进入英语的。

4．第四期借用词--文艺复兴之后
　　文艺复兴时期，欧洲学者们致力于对古典文化的研究。古典语言（拉丁语、希腊语）和古典文学成为教育的主要内容。从十六世纪到十八世纪，文学家、科学家都用拉丁语写论文，如培根（Francis Bacon）、牛顿（Isaac Newton, 1642--1727）的著作便是这样。
　　据《牛津大词典》的资料，在文艺复兴时期进入英语的外来词有一万二千个以上，其中绝大部分来自法语或拉丁语。这些词大多属于学术性的词汇，例如表示抽象概念的词和科技术语。英语词汇中大部分属于欧洲语言国际性成分的词全部源自这一批拉丁词。

-tion，-sion这些的都是拉丁语；-logy、th、ty这样的往往是希腊语。

n属于气很多的音，t任然不少 以后有n 必出t

### con发音
condition -- \ kən-ˈdi-shən 注意发音o发ə

refusal n.
the act of refusing to do or accept sth
the act of saying that you will not do or accept something:
Her request for more money met with a refusal.

frustrated 
annoyed, disappointed, or discouraged:
You just get so frustrated when everything in your vegetable garden is ripe and then the bugs get at them.
feeling annoyed or less confident because you cannot achieve what you want:
Are you feeling frustrated in your present job?

either 
used in negatives instead of also or too:
The restaurant has good food, and it’s not expensive either.

one or the other of two
You can go by train or bus – either way it’ll take an hour.

negative  \ ˈne-gə-tiv 发t 遇到n似乎必出t
### 注意弱化 ə 成 i,次重音也是个标记
literature \ ˈli-tə-rə-ˌchu̇r 注意发音t浊化d ə弱化成i 似乎2音节单词很特殊，

## t规则 辅音和辅音就要延续，辅音和元音就要相对。
辅音在2音节以内无效，以元音为第一.

和前面是否重音没有关系，是否出气的辅音才有关，和前后直接接触的有关,尤其后面，辅音遇到元音，浊化最佳，
遇到n r 似乎必出t
l不出

舌头位置在前面就T : r n
舌头位置在后面就D : l b
舌头在前，几乎都出气，可以夸张的验证 
比如b 出气就是p 了，所以b不出

type of 根据个人理论 连续已经是讲前后当成一个词了，所以 typeof p前后是元音,并且在3音节以内(保证了辅音不起规则，元音优先)， 所以p 都是浊化

发d :
little butter settle mortal after(弹舌) hospital(次重音在s) stability(看b)
发t: 重音 次重音 必发t
gentle mantle pivotal digital retail(有意思，可能是次重音缘故)
总结:能省则省，但是n后面没音了，为了保证继续能起头发t，太长的音节为了保证t有声，最后的也是t
t: 有n(用t打破n导致的非元声状态) ， 长的，重音
d: 前后元音(t和元音是相对存在)，短的，非重音 (stability长的本音出来t，但是重音是b所以还是出不来)
只有mn才其实拖出了气了，所以需要t(需要t重新拉起声音)，r不会,f也不会(after)...目前都不会
hospital因为重音在s，所以t算2音节，不算3音节长的
看元音，就是d, 
辅音有气的，s f +t t浊化，因为话这些音引导出浊化结束发音了，配合(2音节经典)
2音节以上看下面
辅音无气的 m n, t必须发生了，因为没音了，要t
2音节以上理论要t，看重音的音，清就保持t
浊就d, digital 或许是因为后面的l,或者g出气了
facility \ fə-ˈsi-lə-tē t
digital \ ˈdi-jə-tᵊl t
priority -- \ prī-ˈȯr-ə-tē --- t
majority \ mə-ˈjȯr-ə-tē t
stability \ stə-ˈbi-lə-tē d
optical -- \ ˈäp-ti-kəl 发d
看重音开始:
前面有清辅，或有r 这样的发声了，后面t不需要停下来.
前面没有有气的发声带出，也没有完全被 m, n 结束，"有音无气状态"， 需要浊化的d继续保持
不能光看音节，要看比如以下，p 是否参与了引导元音的状态，才决定有没有气
optical -- \ ˈäp-ti-kəl

4.t音的消失 当/t/位于/n/于元音之间时

Internet ’In（t）∂nз:t

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/109230363

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/89660011

美式发音中，当/t/和/p/在单词的中间，且后面的音属于非重读音节，则/t/浊化成/d/，/p/浊化成/b/。

例：butter /ˈbʌdər/，open/ˈəʊbən/

city/ˈsɪdi/，little/ˈlɪdl/

（美音中/t/音的浊化大大促进了英语流畅、放松的发音，/d/音是非常平滑的音，/t/音需要更多的体力，/d/发音时肌肉无需太紧张。美音中的/p/也可以浊化成/b/，但没有/t/的浊化常见。）

/t/和/d/的完全省略

1）当/t/和/d/音在两个辅音中间时，可以完全省略。

例：must do /t/音完全省略

2）/t/和/d/在词尾时，通常会失去爆破或省略。

（在交流中，单词是有语境的，不是独立存在的，因此省略尾音后，不会对交流造成影响。


4：/t/，/d/，/s/，/z/分别和/j/的连读

1）/t/+/j/=/tʃ/

例：can’t you do it /kæntʃu:/

what your name is /wɒtʃɔ:r/

2）/d/+/j/=/dʒ/

例：did you /dɪdʒu:/

find your /faɪndʒɔ:r/

（do you 也常常连读为/dʒu:/，连读时do中的o不发音）

3）/s/+/j/=/ʃ/

例：yes, you are /jeʃu:/

guess your age /ɡeʃɔ:r/

4）/z/+/j/=/ʒ/

例：how’s your family /haʊʒɔ:r/

she misses you /mɪsɪʒu:/

（you，your和 you’re 在实际发音时，很可能会轻读，you发/jə/，your发/jər/，you’re发/jər/。连读后具体的发音以实际情况为准。）

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/100868878

**一、连读**

**发音规则一：辅音+元音**

一句话中相邻的两个单词，前一个单词以辅音结尾，后一个单词以元音开始，拼读成“辅音+元音”。

**讲解：**你还记得汉语拼音中有些单词xi'an（西安）、ku'ai（酷爱）吗？如果去掉隔音符，就成了xian（先）、kuai（快）了。英文中几乎所有的句子都是从头拼到尾，简单地说：连音就是两个单词相遇能拼读就拼，不能拼读就让过。例如：Take~it~easy


**发音规则二：元音+元音**

一句话中相邻的两个单词，前一个单词以元音结尾，后一个单词以元音开始，则在两个元音之间加上一个轻微的 [j] 或 [w] 的音，拼读成“元音+ [j] 或 [w] +元音”。

**[i:]或[eɪ]结尾的元音+[j]+元音**

**以[u:]或 [əʊ] 结尾的元音+[w]+元音**

**发音规则三** **省略 [h] 的连续**

在连音规则中，以“h”开头的单词 [h] 音近乎省略。因为 [h] 发音很特殊——只是出气没有摩擦，所以拼读时好像被省略了。


**二、略读**

英文最明显的语音规则除了连读外，就是略读了。爆破音和爆破音相邻，第一个爆破音只形成阻碍，但不发生爆破，称为失爆；爆破音和其他辅音相邻，该爆破音不完全爆破。英语语音中的失爆和不完全爆破现象，我们简称为“略读”。略读是英语语音学习的重点，也是一个难点，掌握好略读，也就掌握了地道英语发音的制胜法宝！

**注意：**略读时并不是把整个音丢掉，而是发音时点到为止，有口型不发音或轻微发音。重要学术名词--爆破音：[p] [b] [t] [d] [k] [g]


**1、爆破音+爆破音=失去爆破**

**Tips：**  
六个爆破音中任意两个相遇，一个爆破音后紧跟着另一个爆破音时，前面一个音点到为止，形成阻碍，但不发生爆破；第二个音完全爆破；若第二个爆破音在词尾，则必须轻化。以一个爆破音结尾并以同一个爆破音开始时，只发一次音，前一个音只做好发音准备而不发音，直接发第二个音。

**2、爆破音[t]和[d]+鼻辅音[m]和[n]**

爆破音[t]和[d]后面紧跟鼻辅音[m]和[n]，[t]和[d]形成阻碍，在词末必须通过鼻腔爆破；发音时，舌尖紧贴上齿龈，稍放开立刻贴回，从爆破音到鼻音舌位不变，让气流通过鼻腔冲出，在词中则不完全爆破。



**3、爆破音[t]和[d]+舌边音[l]**

爆破音[t]和[d]后面紧跟舌边音[l]，则必须由舌两边爆破，这种情况多发生在词尾。爆破音爆破音[t]和[d]后面紧跟清晰舌边[l]，则为不完全爆破。

**4、爆破音+摩擦音/破擦音=失去爆破**

当爆破音后紧跟着摩擦音和破擦音时，该爆破音形成阻碍，但不完全爆破。  
摩擦音：[f][v][θ][ ð][s][ z][ ʃ][ ʒ ][h][r]

破擦音：[ts]-[dz],[tr]-[dr],[tʃ]-[dʒ]

　　如果你平时的编程工作涉及到业务功能，而不是纯粹的技术架构，一定会使用到数据库。SQL 就是数据的语言，通过它你可以和数据建立连接和沟通。如果你的数据访问模式写得很差，轻则代码性能一塌糊涂，重则引发 Bug，而涉及数据的问题，Bug 等级都比较高，后果可能很严重。

[To solve it I did the following](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync/issues/321)
我做的第二步，然后他自己生成了token,验证了本地客户端(# Success! You may now close this tab.)，然后找几个gist不用的，重新传
1.  regenerate the token
2.  reset settings + delete all the lines in settings.json with sync.*
3.  restarted VS Code
4.  upload settings



一直以为查单词，查字典就行了，原来修行如此重要，因为字典也有根源，字典的起源怎么来的。美国传统词典The American Heritage dictionary 的标准，音标等等，有何意义
